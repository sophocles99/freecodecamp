          Some key facts about Bill Gates's life:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Gates was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington. His
            father was an attorney; his parents pushed him to pursue a career in
            law. However, Gates loved electronics and wrote his first software
            program at the age of 13 that allowed a user to play tic-tac-toe
            against the computer. Looks like electronics beat law.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gates co-founded Traf-O-Data in 1972 with Paul Allen and Paul
            Gilbert; they used an Intel processor to make traffic counters. He
            was 17 years old. After Traf-O-Data, he spent a short time as a
            congressional page in the House of Representatives.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1975, he dropped out of Harvard with support from his parents.
            Later that year, Allen and Gates started working with Micro
            Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) to distribute software.
            Due to the duo's compatibility, Allen came up with the name
            “Micro-Soft” to describe their partnership.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gates began dating Melinda Gates, formerly Melinda French, in 1987
            after meeting at a Microsoft event. They got married in 1994 and the
            couple now has three children in their early 20s. The Gates main
            residence is in Medina, Washington. When Gates was 31 he became the
            world's youngest billionaire.
